Gitbook support the [Gitbook Editor](https://github.com/GitbookIO/editor) for writing gitbook. It's great and you can see easily your chapter list. However, I can't use the gitbook editor because it's doesn't support the unicode. So, I create this app for personal use. Just open the Gitbook folder and it will show the list from your summary. Just click and open your markdown file with your default mac editor.
